The sflux_inputs.txt file should not require parameterising unless we go to domains where we want to use muliple atmospheric forcings (e.g. ACCESS + high res CCAM). 
However, I wonder if things like the variable names (uwind, vwind, prmsl) need to be updated to match what is in the sflux files if they match the origin datasets - ACCESS-G uses different var names to CCAM. If so, these fields should be parameterised.
